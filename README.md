# Multi-thread Counting
Counting the number of perfect numbers between 1 and N with multithread.

This multithread Java application counts the number of perfect numbers between 1 and N. 
It splits the counting perfect numbers between 1...N into equal subtasks that threads can perform in parallel and aggregate the results.
